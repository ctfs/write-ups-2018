# CSAW RED Quals 2018 : Interactive Vision Air

**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 100

**Description:**

We got an awesome new take on the visionair cipher that iterates over a key in order to encrypt/decrypt flags. Basically we iterate over a key for a length _l_ and encrypt the plaintext using that chunk of the key. The ciphertext is made up of chunks of size _l_ of each individual cipher. The cipher text is `fmcj{aj_rzxn_mpxc_knwxabb}`. Use the flag format to your advantage in cracking the code.
