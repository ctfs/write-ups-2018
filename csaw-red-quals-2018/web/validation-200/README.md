**Category:** Web
**Points:** 200
**Solves:** 41
**Description:**

Now you have to do your homework!
When you submit a homework assignment, the submission will be validated on the server. What this means, is that your homework submission will be rendered in a webpage on the server! Some nasty things can happen here......
This challange requires you to send the flag to a public IP address (one that you control).
The flag is at /flag.txt, but it can only be accesed by the server itself!
